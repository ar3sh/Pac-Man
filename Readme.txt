## Introduction

This code provides a basic implementation of the Pac-Man game where the player controls Pac-Man to eat all the pebbles while avoiding the ghosts. It uses OpenGL for graphics rendering.

## Features

- Pac-Man movement and animation
- Ghost movement and AI
- Collision detection
- Scorekeeping and lives counter

## Dependencies

- C Standard Library
- OpenGL
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using an appropriate C compiler.
3. Execute the compiled binary.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to control Pac-Man's movement:
  - UP: Move Pac-Man up
  - DOWN: Move Pac-Man down
  - LEFT: Move Pac-Man left
  - RIGHT: Move Pac-Man right

## Gameplay

- The objective of the game is to eat all the pebbles on the board while avoiding the ghosts.
- When Pac-Man eats a super pebble, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for extra points.
- The game is over if Pac-Man loses all its lives or eats all the pebbles.
